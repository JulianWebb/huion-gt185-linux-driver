# Huion GT-185 Driver

See [Jos√© Luis Cruz's excellent repo for more info](https://github.com/joseluis/huion-linux-drivers)

This has been modified to work with my tablet, the Huion GT-185. Main issue was a change in the packets recieved via USB but it also has configurations meant for my laptop specifically and a bit of a left-handedness tweak

Scrollbar section was removed from the main loop because this tablet doesn't have a scrollbar

I have no current plans to maintain this, use at own risk of failure
